This article covers many of the new CSS rules, properties, and concepts for
styling [Custom Elements](/platform/custom-elements.html). While much of it is applicable to general Web Components, it specifically focuses on:

1. How to use these new CSS features with {{site.project_title}}
2. How {{site.project_title}}'s polyfills shim certain behaviors

Many of the topics outlined in this article are closely related to how CSS and Shadow DOM interact with each other. If you want the dirty details on styling Shadow DOM, see my article on HTML5Rocks.com, [Shadow DOM 201 - CSS and Styling](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom-201/).

## Default styles

Most elements in HTML have default styling applied by the browser. For example,
`<head>` and `<title>` are `display: none`, `<div>` is `display: block`,
`<body>` has `margin: 8px`, and list items are `list-style-type: disc`.

### User-provided styles

As with any HTML element, users of your Custom Element can define styles on it:

    <style>
      x-foo {
        display: block;
      }
      x-foo:hover {
        opacity: 0;
      }
    </style>

    <x-foo></x-foo>

However, it's common for a Custom Element to define its own look. 

### Element-defined styles

**Heads up**: `@host` was replaced with `:host()` in the Shadow DOM spec.
{: .alert .alert-error}

Elements _you_ create will likely need some sort of styling. `:host` and `:host()` allows you to target and style a custom element internally from within its definition:

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" noscript>
      <template>
        <style>
          :host {
            display: block; /* Note: by default elements are always display:inline. */
          }
        </style>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

`:host` refers to the custom element itself and has the lowest specificity. This allows
users to override your styling from the outside.

#### Reacting to user states

An interesting application of `:host` is for reacting to different user-driven states (:hover, :focus, :active, etc.):

    <polymer-element name="x-button" noscript>
      <template>
        <style>
          :host {
            opacity: 0.6;
            transition: opacity 400ms ease-in-out;
          }
          :host:hover { opacity: 1; }
          :host:active { ... }
        </style>
        <button><content></content></button>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

    <x-button>x-buttonz!</x-button>

When someone mouses over `<x-button>` they'll get a sexy fade-in!

**Demo:** <x-button-example>x-buttonz!</x-button-example>

#### Theming an element

The selector `:host(<selector>)` matches the host element if it or any of its ancestors matches `<selector>`.

**Example** - color the element if an ancestor has the `different` class:

    :host(.different) {
      color: red;
    }

One reason you might find `:host()` useful is for theming. For example, many people do theming by applying a class to `<html>` or `<body>`. 

    <body class="different">
      <x-foo></x-foo>
    </body>

**Example** - theming an element by outside classes

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" noscript>
      <template>
        <style>
          :host(.different) { ... }
        </style>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

    <body class="different">
      <x-foo></x-foo>
    </body>

Note, you can also write a rule that matches only if the host itself has the `.different` class. For example:

    <x-foo class="different"></x-foo>

matches

    :host(.different:host) {
      ...  
    }

#### Programmatically modifying styles

You can dynamically change an element's styling by, you guessed it, modifying 
ts `.style` property.

From the outside:

    var xFoo = document.createElement('x-foo');
    xFoo.style.background = 'blue';

From within the element:

{% raw %}
    <polymer-element name="x-foo" on-click="{{changeBg}}">
      <template>
        <style>
          :host {
            display: inline-block;
            background: red;
            color: white;
          }
        </style>
        <div>Click me</div>
      </template>
      <script>
        Polymer('x-foo', {
          changeBg: function() {
            this.style.background = 'blue'; 
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>
{% endraw %}

**Demo:** <x-bgchange-example></x-bgchange-example>

If you're feeling loco, it's possible to modify the rules in an `:host`
block using CSSOM:

{% raw %}
    <polymer-element name="x-foo" on-click="{{changeBg}}">
      <template>
        <style>
          :host { background: red; }
        </style>
      </template>
      <script>
        Polymer('x-foo', {
          changeBg: function() {
            var sheet = this.shadowRoot.querySelector('style').sheet;
            // Brittle if :host isn't first in <style>.
            var hostRules = sheet.cssRules[0];
            // Append the rule to the end.
            hostRules.insertRule(':host:hover { color: white; }',
                                 hostRules.cssRules.length);
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>
{% endraw %}

The only reason to do this would be to programmatically add/remove pseudo-class rules.
It's also worth noting that this trick doesn't work under {{site.project_title}}'s Shadow DOM polyfill.
See [issue #23](https://github.com/Polymer/platform/issues/23).

## Preventing FOUC

When you declare `<x-foo>` (or any non-native HTML element), it exists
happily on the page as a regular `HTMLElement`. Only when the browser registers its definition
does `<x-foo>` become magical.

Before an element gets registered, the process of upgrading it may take more time than expected.
For example, an [HTML Import](/platform/html-imports.html) that defines your element might
be slow due to poor network conditions.

To combat these types of UX issues and mitigate things like [FOUC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content), you can use the CSS `:unresolved` pseudo class. It applies to unknown elements right up until the point the lifecycle `createdCallback` is called.

**Support:** CSS `:unresolved` is supported natively in Chrome 29. If you're using
a browser where it is not available natively, use {{site.project_title}}'s [FOUC prevention](/docs/polymer/styling.html#fouc-prevention) features.
{: .alert .alert-success}

**Example:** fade in an element when it's registered

    <style>
      x-foo {
        opacity: 1;
        transition: opacity 300ms;
      }
      x-foo:unresolved {
        opacity: 0;
      }
    </style>

**Example:** using generated content to display a "loading" message

    <style>
      :unresolved {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
        border: 1px dashed #ccc;
        border-radius: 5px;
      }
      :unresolved:after {
        padding: 15px;
        content: 'loading...';
        color: #ccc;
      }
    </style>

### Polyfilling :unresolved

{{site.project_title}} provides the `[unresolved]` attribute to polyfill the CSS
`:unresolved` pseudo class. See [FOUC prevention](/docs/polymer/styling.html#fouc-prevention). The attribute is automatically removed from elements at `WebComponentsReady` ready time, the
event that signifies all elements have been upgraded.

**Example**

    <style>
      x-foo[unresolved] {
        /* custom styling */ 
      }
    </style>
    <x-foo unresolved></x-foo>


## Inheriting / resetting outside styles

As a convenience, {{site.project_title}} allows you to set Shadow DOM's `applyAuthorStyles` and `resetStyleInheritance` properties directly when constructing the element's `prototype`.
However, please keep in mind that {{site.project_title}} does not attempt to polyfill `applyAuthorStyles` or `resetStyleInheritance`.

Take on the look and feel of the page with `applyAuthorStyles`:

    Polymer('x-foo', {
      applyAuthorStyles: true,
      //resetStyleInheritance: true,
      ready: function() { ... },
      ...
    });

Alternatively, you can set either of these at any time directly on the shadowRoot:

    ready: function() {
      this.shadowRoot.applyAuthorStyles = true;
      this.shadowRoot.resetStyleInheritance = false; // default.
    }

**Remember:** styles defined in the main document continue to apply to the Light DOM nodes they target,
even if those nodes are distributed into Shadow DOM. Basically, going into an insertion point doesn't change what styles are applied. An example helps illustrate this point:

    <style>
      x-foo > div {
        color: green;
      }
      .red {
        color: red; 
      }
    </style>

    <polymer-element name="x-foo">
      <template>
        <div class="red">Shadow DOM: red when applyAuthorStyles=true</div>
        <content select="div"></content>
      </template>
      <script>
        Polymer('x-foo', {
          applyAuthorStyles: true
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

    <x-foo>
      <div>Light DOM: green</div>
    </x-foo>

<style>
  x-foo-example2 > div {
    color: green;
  }
  .red {
    color: red; 
  }
</style>

**Demo:**

<x-foo-example2 style="margin-bottom:20px;">
  <div>Light DOM: green</div>
</x-foo-example2>

The element's Shadow DOM `<div class="red">` matches the `.red` class when
`applyAuthorStyles` is true. When it's false, we're not "applying the authors styles"
and it doesn't match. The distributed `<div>Light DOM: green</div>` remains green because
it's logically still in the parent page and therefore matching `x-foo > div`.
It's simple being rendered elsewhere (over in Shadow DOM land).

**Gotcha**: Even with `.applyAuthorStyles` set, selectors don't cross Shadow DOM boundaries.
Styles on the outside only apply when the selector in question matches entirely
in or outside the shadowRoot. For example, `x-foo .red { color: red; }` does not
match the inner `<div class="red">`.
{: .alert .alert-info }

## Styling internal markup {#style-shadowdom}

### From inside the element {#style-frominside}

To style the internal markup of an element, include a `<link>` or `<style>` tag
inside the topmost `<template>`:

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" noscript>
      <template>
        <style>
          p {
            padding: 5px;
          }
          #message {
            color: blue;
          }
          .important {
            font-weight: bold;
          }
        </style>
        <div id="message">I'm a status message!</div>
        <p>Web components are great</p>
        <footer class="important">That is all</footer>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

Scoped styling is one of the many features of Shadow DOM. Styles defined inside
the shadow tree don't leak out and page styles don't bleed in.

{{site.project_title}} creates Shadow DOM from the topmost `<template>`
of your `<polymer-element>` definition, so styles defined internally to your element
are scoped to your element. There's no need to worry about duplicating an id
from the outside or using a styling rule that's too broad.

**Note** For browsers that don't support Shadow DOM natively, the polyfill
attempts to mimic scoped styling as much as possible. See the
[polyfill details on scoped styling](/docs/polymer/styling.html#polyfill-details).
{: .alert .alert-info }

If you need to style nodes distributed into your element from the user's Light DOM,
see [styling distributed nodes](#style-distributed).

## Defining style hooks {#style-hooks}

**Heads up:** The `pseudo` attribute and `::x-*` custom pseudo elements were 
replaced by `part="<name>"` and `::part(<name>)`, respectively.
{: .alert .alert-error}

Nodes in your element that contain the `part` attribute can be targeted directly from outside CSS.
These are called custom pseudo elements. Essentially, they give users a way to style specific pieces of your element by exposing some of its internal structure.

To make a custom pseudo element in your Shadow DOM, include `part="<name>"` on the node. Users can then style that element from the outside using `::part(<name>)`.

**Example**

    <style>
      x-foo::part(heading) {
        color: black;
        background: yellow;
      }
    </style>

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" noscript>
      <template>
        <h1 part="heading">I'm an x-foo!</h1>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

    <x-foo></x-foo>
{%endcomment%}

#### Styling distributed nodes {#style-distributed}

**Heads up:** `::content` replaced `::distributed()` as the way to style distributed nodes.
{: .alert .alert-error}

`<content>` elements allow you to select nodes from the ["Light DOM"](/platform/shadow-dom.html#shadow-dom-subtrees) and render them at predefined locations in your element. The CSS `::content` pseudo element is a way to style nodes that pass through an insertion point. For example, 
you can a rule like `::content > *`.

**Full example**

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" noscript>
      <template>
        <style>
          content[select="p"]::content * { /* anything distributed here */
            font-weight: bold;
          }
          /* @polyfill p:first-child */
          ::content p:first-child {
            color: red;
          }
          /* @polyfill footer > p */
          ::content footer > p {
            color: green;
          }
          /* @polyfill :host > p */
          ::content > p { /* scope relative selector */
            color: blue;
          }
        </style>
        <content select="p"></content>
        <content></content>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

    <!-- Children of x-foo are the Light DOM -->
    <x-foo>
      <p>I'm red and bold</p>
      <p>I'm blue and bold</p>
      <footer>
        <p>I'm also red</p>
        <p>I'm green</p>
        <span>I'm black</span>
      </footer>
    </x-foo>

**Note**: For complex styling like distribute nodes, {{site.project_title}} provides the `@polyfill`
directives to polyfill certain Shadow DOM features. See the [Styling reference](/docs/polymer/styling.html#polyfill-styling-directives) for more information on the directives.
{: .alert .alert-info }

### From outside the element {#style-fromoutside}

The `^^` (Cat) and `^` (Hat) combinators pierce through Shadow DOM's boundaries can
can style elements within different shadow trees.

#### The ^ combinator {#hat}

The `^` combinator is generally equivalent to a descendant combinator (e.g. `div p {...}`), except **it crosses one shadow boundary**.

    <style>
      x-foo ^ p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" noscript>
      <template>
        <div>I am red!</div>
        <content></content>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

    <x-foo>
      <div>I am not red.</div>
    </x-foo>

**Demo:**

<style>
  x-foo-cat ^ div {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<x-foo-cat style="margin-bottom:20px;">
  <div>I am not red.</div>
</x-foo-cat>

A more full fledged example is styling a tabs component, say `<x-tabs>`. It has `<x-panel>` children in its Shadow DOM, each of which has an `h2` heading. To style those headings from the main page, one could use
the `^` combinator like so:

{%raw%}
    <style>
      x-tabs ^ x-panel ^ h2 {
        ...
      }
    </style>

    <polymer-element name="x-tabs" noscript>
      <template>
        <x-panel heading="Title">
          <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
        </x-panel>
        ...
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

    <polymer-element name="x-panel" attributes="heading" noscript>
      <template>
        <h2>{{heading}}</h2>
        <content>No content provided.</content>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

    <x-tabs></x-tabs>
{%endraw%}

#### The ^^ combinator {#cat}

The `^^` combinator is similar to `^`, but more powerful. It completely ignores all boundaries and crosses into any number of shadow trees**. 

**Example** style all `h2` elements that are descendants of an `<x-tabs>`, anywhere in a shadow tree:

    x-tabs ^^ h2 {
      ...
    }

**Example** style all elements with the class `.library-theme`, anywhere in a shadow tree:

    body ^^ .library-theme {
      ...
    }

## Conclusion

There are a bunch of new concepts when it comes to styling Custom Elements. What makes
things particularly interesting (and at the same time, wonky) is this Shadow DOM guy.
In web development, we're conditioned to think, "Yay! Globals everywhere!" That goes
for DOM, CSS, and JS. Not so with Custom Elements. It's a brave new world, but a powerful one
of encapsulation, puppies, and fluffy bunnies. Drink it in.
