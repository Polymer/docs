## Setup & installation {#intall}

### Using Bower {#installing-polymer}

The recommended way to get the pieces of **{{site.project_title}} {{site.latest_version}}** is through [Bower](http://bower.io/). We've chosen Bower because removes the hassle of dependency management when developing
or consuming elements.

#### Getting the packages

Everything is à la carte in {{site.project_title}}, so get the parts you're interested in.
After running one of these commands, Bower creates a `bower_components/` directory and populates it with the packages (and their dependencies) as siblings folders.

**Tip:** `--save` adds the item as dependencies in *your* app's bower.json.
{: .alert .alert-success }

- Install and use the {{site.project_title}} <i class="icon-puzzle-piece elements"></i> <b class="elements">elements</b>:

        bower install --save Polymer/polymer-elements
        bower install --save Polymer/polymer-ui-elements

    **Note:** installing a set of elements also installs the `Polymer/platform` and `Polymer/polymer` dependencies. You do not need to run the other install commands.

- To build {{site.project_title}} elements, install the <i class="icon-beaker core"></i> <b class="core">core</b> sugaring:

        bower install --save Polymer/polymer

    **Note:** this also gets you `Polymer/platform`.

- Only interested in the <i class="icon-cogs foundation"></i> <b class="foundation">polyfill</b> libraries? Install them standalone:

        bower install --save Polymer/platform

#### Test your environment {#testbower}

In the folder where you ran `bower install`, create an `index.html` that loads `platform.js`
and imports the `<polymer-ui-tabs>` element:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <script src="bower_components/platform/platform.js"></script>
        <link rel="import"
              href="bower_components/polymer-ui-tabs/polymer-ui-tabs.html">
      </head>
      <body>
        <polymer-ui-tabs selected="0">
          <span>One</span><span>Two</span><span>Three</span><span>Four</span><span>Five</span>
        </polymer-ui-tabs>
      </body>
    </html>

Fire up a web server, navigate to `index.html`, and feast on your accomplishments.
You should see a tabs component like the one below.

<iframe src="/components/polymer-ui-tabs/smoke.html" style="border:none;height:80px;width:100%;"></iframe>

#### Updating packages {#updatebower}

When a new version of {{site.project_title}} is available, run `bower update`
in your app directory to update your copy:

    bower update

This updates all packages in `bower_components/`.

### Using git {#git}

As an alternative to Bower, you can clone {{site.project_title}}'s important repositories
by running our `pull-all.sh` script:

    mkdir polymer_local; cd polymer_local
    git clone https://github.com/Polymer/tools.git
    ./tools/bin/pull-all.sh

<!-- <p class="centered"><a href="/tools/pull-all.sh" target="_blank" class="btn btn-success" alt="Download pull-all.sh" title="Download pull-all.sh"><i class="icon-white icon-download"></i> Download pull-all.sh</a></p>
 -->

Go grab a coffee. This takes a few minutes!

`pull-all.sh` is great for hacking on the code or if you want the individual polyfill repositories.
Running this script sets things up differently than Bower. It creates two directories, `components/` and `projects/`, and checks out a number of sibling repositories to each folder.

**components/**

- *components/platform/platform.js* — The platform shims and polyfills.
- *components/polymer/polymer.js* — [{{site.project_title}} core](polymer.html)
- *components/polymer-elements/* — A folder of the meta collection of the core utility elements.
- *components/polymer-ui-elements/* — A folder of the meta collection of the UI elements.
- A directory for each polyfill repo (CustomElements, HTMLImports, ShadowDOM).

**projects/**

Full and sample applications.

#### Test your environment {#testgit}

To check that your development environment is ready, try trying the playground tool:

    cd projects/designer
    bower install

Start a web server and navigate to the designer app.

#### Updating checkouts {#updategit}

To update your local copies, re-run `pull-all.sh`:

    ./tools/bin/pull-all.sh

## About the repositories {#abouttherepos}

**Note:** This section should be used for reference purposes only. We recommend
[using Bower](#bower) to install and work with {{site.project_title}}.
{: .alert }

The entirety of the {{site.project_title}} is composed of a many Git
repositories. All of the polyfill libraries, projects, and individual elements
each have their own repository.

### Specification repositories (da polyfills)

Each new web platform specification has a corresponding polyfill repository. The
reasoning for this is two-fold:

1. make the polyfills work across all modern browsers
2. each polyfill can stand on its own and be used à la carte in projects.

For example, the following repositories may be useful if you're interested in the individual API:

* `CustomElements`
* `HTMLImports`
* `PointerEvents`
* `PointerGestures`
* `ShadowDOM`
* `web-animations-js`
