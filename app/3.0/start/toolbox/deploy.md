In this step, you'll deploy your application to the web.

## Build for deployment

Type `polymer build` to build your Polymer application for production. 

You can serve different builds of your app to browsers with different capabilities. The Polymer Starter Kit is configured to create three builds:

* `esm-bundled`: JavaScript code is served without compilation as ES modules.

* `es6-bundled`: JavaScript code is compiled to ES2015 and uses AMD modules.

* `es5-bundled`: JavaScript code is compiled to ES5 and uses AMD modules.

In this step, you'll deploy `es6-bundled`. Builds are configured in the `builds` object in `polymer.json`, a configuration file in the top-level project folder:

polymer.json { .caption}

```
...
"builds": [
{
  "name": "esm-bundled", ...
},
{
  "name": "es6-bundled", ...
}
{
  "name": "es5-bundled", ...
}
]
...
```

The builds will be output to subfolders under the `build/` folder as follows:

    build/
      esm-bundled/
      es6-bundled/
      es5-bundled/

To configure a custom build, you can use command line options, or edit `polymer.json`. Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/toolbox/build-for-production).

## Deploy to a server

Polymer applications can be deployed to any web server.

This template uses the `<app-location>` element to enable URL-based routing,
which requires that the server serve the `index.html` entry point for all
routes.

You can follow one of the sections below to deploy this app to either
[Google AppEngine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) or [Firebase
Static Hosting](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/), which are both free and
secure approaches for deploying a Polymer app. The approach
is similar for other hosting providers.

### Deploy with AppEngine

1.  Download the [Google App Engine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads)
and follow the instructions for your platform to install it. This tutorial uses the Python SDK.

1.  [Sign up for an AppEngine account](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

1.  [Open the project dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)
and create a new project.

    * Click the Create Project button.
    * Type a project name.
    * Click the Create button.
    
    The App Engine gives you a project ID based on the name of your project.
    Make note of this ID.

1.  `cd` into the main folder for your app (e.g. `my-app/`).

1. Create an `app.yaml` file with the following contents:

    ```
    runtime: python27
    api_version: 1
    threadsafe: yes

    handlers:
    - url: /node_modules
      static_dir: build/es6-bundled/node_modules
      secure: always

    - url: /images
      static_dir: build/es6-bundled/images
      secure: always

    - url: /src
      static_dir: build/es6-bundled/src
      secure: always

    - url: /manifest.json
      static_files: build/es6-bundled/manifest.json
      upload: build/es6-bundled/manifest.json
      secure: always

    - url: /service-worker.js
      static_files: build/es6-bundled/service-worker.js
      upload: build/es6-bundled/service-worker.js
      secure: always

    - url: /.*
      static_files: build/es6-bundled/index.html
      upload: build/es6-bundled/index.html
      secure: always

    skip_files:
    - build/es5-bundled/
    - build/esm-bundled/
    - images/
    - node_modules/
    - src/
    - test/
    ```

1. Set your project id to the ID given to your app by the App Engine. For example:
   
       gcloud config set project my-app-164409

1. Create your app:
   
       gcloud app create
     
   You will need to select a region for your app to be deployed in. This can't be changed.

1. Deploy your app:
   
       gcloud app deploy

1. Your app will be available online at its designated URL. For example:
   
       https://my-app-164409.appspot.com/new-view
   
   Open your app URL in your browser by typing this command:
   
       gcloud app browse

### Deploy with Firebase

The instructions below are based on the [Firebase hosting quick start
guide](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.html).

1.  [Sign up for a Firebase account](https://www.firebase.com/signup/).

1.  Go to [https://www.firebase.com/account](https://www.firebase.com/account) to create a new app. Make note of the project ID associated with your app.

    ![Welcome to Firebase showing Project ID](/images/2.0/toolbox/welcome-firebase.png)

1.  Install the Firebase command line tools.

        npm install -g firebase-tools

1.  `cd` into your project folder.

1.  Inititalize the Firebase application.

        firebase login
        firebase init

1.  Firebase asks you for a project to associate with your app. Select the one you created earlier.

1.  Firebase asks you the name of your app's public folder. Enter `build/es6-bundled/`.

1.  Edit your firebase configuration to add support for URL routing. The final
    `firebase.json` file should look something like this:
	
    ```
    {
      "hosting": {
        "public": "build/es6-bundled/",
        "rewrites": [
          {
            "source": "**/!(*.*)",
            "destination": "/index.html"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```	

    This instructs Firebase to serve up `index.html` for any URLs that don't
    otherwise end in a file extension.

1. Deploy your project.
   
       firebase deploy
   
   The URL to your live site is listed in the output. You can also open
   the site in your default browser by running `firebase open hosting:site`.
