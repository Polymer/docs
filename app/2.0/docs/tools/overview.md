title: Tools overview
---

The Polymer Project offers a range of tools for developing, building, and 
optimizing Polymer elements and apps. 

You can use Polymer CLI for the vast majority of your Polymer development tasks. 
Read [Polymer CLI](polymer-cli) to get started. 

For use cases Polymer CLI doesn't handle, you can customize your toolchain. 
Check out [Advanced tools](advanced) for a description of the underlying tools 
that Polymer CLI is composed of, and then use a build tool like Grunt or 
Gulp to automate your workflow. 

In addition, the [Services](services) doc lists some web services that you may find useful when developing with Polymer (such as the Polygit development CDN for rapidly prototyping elements).
