title: Optimize for production

<!-- toc -->

The Polymer CLI includes a `build` command to generate a production-ready build of your application. This process can include minifying code, compiling JavaScript, automatic service worker generation, and more.

Polymer CLI's build process works best with applications that follow the [app shell architecture](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell). To configure your app as an App Shell application, create a `polymer.json` file at the top-level of your project and set the `entrypoint`, `shell`, and `fragments` options for your application.

You can configure your build via the following command-line flags. However, we reccomend saving these values in your polymer.json. That way there's no concern about remembering the same flags for every build. [See the `polymer.json` specification for more information](polymer-json).

* [`--add-service-worker`](#service-workers)
* [`--bundle`](#bundles)
* [`--css-minify`](#css-minify)
* [`--entry`](#entrypoint)
* [`--html-minify`](#html-minify)
* [`--insert-prefetch-links`](#prefetch)
* [`--js-compile`](#js-compile)
* [`--js-minify`](#js-minify)
* [`--shell`](#shell)
* [`--fragment`](#fragment)

#### `--add-service-worker` {#service-workers}

Generate a service worker for your application to cache all files and assets on the client.

Polymer CLI will generate a service worker for your build using the
[sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache) library. To customize your service worker, create a `sw-precache-config.js` file in your project directory that exports your configuration. See the [sw-precache README](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache) for a list of all supported options.

Note that the sw-precache library uses a cache-first strategy for maximum speed and makes some other assumptions about how your service worker should behave. Read the ["Considerations"](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#considerations) section of the sw-precache README to make sure that this is suitable for your application.

#### `--bundle` {#bundles}

By default, fragments are unbundled. This is optimal for HTTP/2-compatible servers and clients.

If the `--bundle` flag is supplied, all fragments are bundled together to reduce the number of file requests. This is optimal for sending to clients or serving from servers that are not HTTP/2 compatible.

#### `--css-minify` {#css-minify}

Minify inlined and external CSS.

#### `--entry` {#entrypoint}

A filename. This is the main entrypoint into your application for all routes. Often times this is your `index.html` file. This file should import the app shell file specified in the [`shell`](#shell) option. It should be minimal since it's loaded and cached for each route.

#### `--html-minify` {#html-minify}

Minify HTMl by removing comments and whitespace.

#### `--insert-prefetch-links` {#prefetch}
Insert prefetch link elements into your fragments so that all dependencies are prefetched immediately. Add dependency prefetching by inserting `<link rel="prefetch">` tags into entrypoint and `<link rel="import">` tags into fragments and shell for all dependencies.

#### `--js-compile` {#js-compile}

Use babel to compile all ES6 JS down to ES5 for older browsers.

#### `--js-minify` {#js-minify}

Minify inlined and external JavaScript.

#### `--shell` {#shell}

The app shell file containing common code for the app.

#### `--fragment` {#fragment}

This flag supports dynamic dependencies. It is an array of any HTML filenames that are not statically linked from the app shell (that is, imports loaded on demand by `importHref`).

If a fragment has static dependencies, provided the fragment is defined in this property, the Polymer build analyzer will find them. You only need to list the file imported by importHref.

In a Polymer app, the files listed in the fragments flag usually contain one or more element definitions that may or may not be required during the userâ€™s interaction with the app, and can thus be lazily loaded.

#### Examples {#examples}

Create a bundled, minified application build:

`polymer build --bundle --js-minify --css-minify --html-minify`

Create an unbundled, minified application build:

`polymer build --js-minify --css-minify --html-minify`
