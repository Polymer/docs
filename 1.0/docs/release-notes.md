## [Release 1.3.1](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.3.1) (2016-03-02) {#v1-3-1}

This release fixes the following issues:

-   [#3461](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3461). Using
    `var()` in a css mixin or custom property definition
    breaks the scoped style of the element. For a full description
    of this issue, see [Known issues in release 1.3.0](#v1-3-0-known-issues).

-   [#3484](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3484). A `dom-bind` may
    render before the entire document is loaded. This may result in a script
    which expects to install API on a `dom-bind` running after it renders,
    resulting in unexpected behavior.

## [Release 1.3.0](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.3.0) (2016-02-22) {#v1-3-0}

This release includes the following new features:

-   [#2348](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2348). Allow late
    upgrading of bound elements. Fixed an issue where setting properties on an
    un-upgraded element Polymer's setters, preventing property effects (bindings,
    observers, and computed properties) from working.

-   [#3023](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3023). Add support for
    `[attribute~="value"]` selector.

-   [#3299](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3299). Support dynamic
    functions for computed annotations. See
    [Support for dynamic functions in bindings](#v1-3-0-dynamic-fns) for details.

-   [#2399](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2399). Add support for
    custom properties in `@keyframes` rules.

-   [#2486](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/pull/2486). Allow newlines in
    computed binding argument list. For example:

        <div hidden$="[[_someVeryLongFunctionName(
            someVeryLongArg,
            anotherCrazyLongArg)]]">


This release fixes the following issues:

-   [#1715](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/1715). Allow two-way binding
    for negated expressions. (For example, `checked="{%raw%}{{!hidden}}{%endraw%}"`.)


-   [#1727](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/1727). Eliminate the need
    to add `:host` or other selector in front of `::content` in some situations.
    This applies if the `<content>` tag is a top-level local DOM child, and there
    are no other local DOM nodes that could match the selector, for example:

        <template>
          <content></content>
        </template>


    If you are using a wrapper element around the `<content>` tag as described
    in [Styling distributed children](devguide/styling.html#styling-distributed-children-content)
    you should keep using the wrapper. For example:

        <dom-module id="styled-content">
          <template>
            <style>
              .wrapper ::content * {
                color: red;
              }
            </style>
            <h2>I am in local DOM</h2>
            <div class="wrapper">
              <content></content>
            </div>
          </template>
          <script>
            Polymer({ is: 'styled-content' });
          </script>
        </dom-module>

    Changing this selector to `::content *` results in the `<h2>` element
    being styled red under shady DOM, because the style rule is rewritten as
    `styled-content *`.

-   [#2291](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/pull/2291). Make `isDebouncerActive`
    actually return a boolean.

-   [#3063](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3063). Templatizer: bug in
    templatize depending on the parent properties. In certain circumstances, an
    element using the Templatizer behavior could throw the error "Uncaught
    TypeError: template._propertySetter is not a function".

-   [#3206](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3206). Camel case declared
    properties with single letter in the middle are ignored. (For example,
    `align-x-axis` did not map to `alignXAxis`.) This was a regression introduced
    by a performance improvement in 1.2.2.

-   [#3221](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3221). Custom properties
    don't use default values if they contain parenthesis. For example:

        background-image: var(--foo-background-image, url(http://placehold.it/400x300));

-   [#3222](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/pull/3222). Fix for scoping when
    class is not specified on element.

-   [#3288](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3288). Fixed a case where
    attribute bindings set a property where they should not have.
    For details, see [Attribute binding fix](#v1-3-0-attribute-binding).

-   [#3326](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3326). Fix incorrect CSS
    specificity when using custom properties. For details, see
    [CSS specificity changes](#v1-3-0-css-specificity).

-   [#3349](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3349). Allow binding to a
    path that includes a dash. (For example, `"{%raw%}{{foo.some-value}}{%endraw%}"`.)

-   [#3365](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3365). Behavior callbacks
    can be called multiple times when a behavior appears more than once in the
    flattened behavior list.

-   [#3405](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3405). Unexpected tap event
    from child when parent fires track events.

-   [#3443](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3443). Attributes bindings
    initially set to `false` are configured to `true`.

-   [#3446](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3446). Elements without
    property effects do not receive configured properties.

-   [#3354](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/pull/3354). Fix ordering of
    property effects.

-   [#3373](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/pull/3373). `dom-template`: Parent
    properties should not override argument-based properties.

-   [#3442](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/pull/3442). Restrict early
    property set to properties that have accessors. This allows users to set
    properties in `created` which are listed in `properties` but which have no
    accessor.


### Support for dynamic functions in bindings (#3299) {#v1-3-0-dynamic-fns}

Computed bindings and observers will trigger when a function changes. Computed
bindings on functions can be used to lazily trigger bindings on external changes,
or encapsulate dependencies.

A good example is a translate function for i18n that depends on external
translation tables.

Example:

    <dom-module id="i18n-string">
      <template>
        [[translate(input)]]
      </template>
      <script>
      Polymer({
        is: 'i18n-string',
        properties: {
          translate: {
            type: Function,
            computed: '_computeTranslateFn(translationService)'
          },
          translationService: {
            type: Function,
            value: function() {
              return function(str){ return str + 'ish'; };
            }
          }
        },
        _computeTranslateFn: function(ts) {
          return function(str) {
            return ts(str);
          }
        }
      });
      </script>
    </dom-module>

    <!-- initially displays "helloish" -->
    <i18n-string input="hello"></i18n-string>

In this example, `<i18n-string>` can wait for `translationService` to be set
before  attempting translations, and updates update translations when
`translationService` is changed. This encapsulates the dependency on
`translationService` in the computed `translate` function, so it doesn't need
to be included in the binding.

### Attribute binding fix (#3288) {#v1-3-0-attribute-binding}

Prior to Polymer v1.3.0, a bug existed related to attribute bindings to unknown
attributes (that is, attributes that do not map to properties that Polymer
creates accessors for). The bug resulted in the value of the attribute being
mirrored to a property of the same name _once_ (but subsequent changes in the
attribute were not mirrored).

Polymer's contract is to only deserialize attributes to properties that Polymer
is managing. That is, properties declared in the `properties` object or used as
dependencies to bindings, observers, or computed functions. You should review
your code to ensure that you're not relying on the unintentional one-time
deserialization of unknown attributes. For example, the following will not
initialize the property `foo`:

```
<!-- binding to unknown attribute: will not deserialize to property -->
<button foo$="{%raw%}{{property}}{%endraw%}">`
```

```
// Passes:
assert(button.getAttribute('foo') == this.property);
// Fails:
assert(button.foo == this.property);
```

If you need to access the _property_ value of a bound element,
you should ensure you are binding to a property as opposed to an attribute:

```
<!-- binding to unknown property always works -->
<button foo="{%raw%}{{property}}{%endraw%}">
```

```
// Passes:
assert(button.foo == this.property);
```

### CSS specificity changes {#v1-3-0-css-specificity}

This release fixes an issue with CSS specificity, where rules that applied
custom properties improperly received higher specificity than a rules with no
custom properties.

    <dom-module id="x-foo">
      <template>
        <style>
          :host {
            background: var(--foo, red);
          }
          :host(.zap) {
            background: orange;
          }
        </style>
        <content></content>
      </template>
      <script>Polymer({is: 'x-foo'});</script>
    </dom-module>

    <x-foo>i am red</x-foo><br>
    <x-foo class='zap'>I should be orange</x-foo>

This fix changes how some styles are shimmed, and may change how some styles
are displayed under shady DOM. In particular: rules defined in a `:host` selector
inside an element's local DOM _should_ be lower specificity than an type selector
in the main document:

    <!-- main document -->
    <style>
      my-element {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>

    <my-element>I should be red.<my-element>

    <!-- my-element.html -->
    <dom-module>
      <template>
        <style>
          :host {
            color: blue;
          }
        </style>
        <content></content>
      </template>
      <script>
        Polymer({ is: 'my-element'});
      </script>
    </dom-module>

With this change, the text in this example renders (incorrectly) as blue under
shady DOM. Using a `custom-style` element for document-level styling corrects
this issue:

    <style is="custom-style">
      my-element {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>

If this solution isn't possible, you can also use a more specific selector in your
document styles (for example, a class selector).

### Known issues in release 1.3.0 {#v1-3-0-known-issues}

The following issue was discovered after the release of 1.3.0:

-   [#3461](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3461).
    Using `var()` in a css mixin or custom property definition
    breaks the scoped style of the element. An
    element with styles like the following triggers this bug:

        <style>
          :host {
            color: white;
            // Apply a custom property when defining a custom property
            --my-property: var(--another-property);
            // OR:
            --my-mixin: {
              // Apply a custom property inside a mixin
              background: var(--my-background);
            }
          }
        </style>

    This issue will be fixed in the next release.

    As a temporary workaround, you can add the following ruleset at the
    beginning of the element's styles (before all other styles).

        /* Workaround for issue #3461 */
        :host {
          --workaround: inherit;
          color: var(--workaround);
          /* existing rules below */
        }


## [Release 1.2.4](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.2.4) (2016-01-27)

This release fixes the following issues:


-   Fixes [2407](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2407). `scopeSubtree`
    doesn't work on SVG elements.

-   Fixes [2506](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2506). Fix for method
    parsing in computed bindings.

-   Fixes [2555](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2555). Produce nicer
    error on malformed observer.

-   Fixes [2617](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2617). Added
    `polymer-mini.html` and `polymer-micro.html` to Bower distribution.

-   Fixes [2645](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2645). Improve
    performance of `Polymer.dom` `prevSibling`, `nextSibling` operations.

-   Fixes [2666](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2666). Fix using
    `value$` on input element.

-   Fixes [2704](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2704). Fix compound
    bindings with braces in literals.

-   Fixes [3018](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3018). Avoid throwing
    with invalid keys/paths. Recent changes caused calls that used to fail
    gracefully  on unexpected input to throw exceptions, which could cause
    unexpected breakage. For example, the following calls improperly generated
    an exception:

    -   Calling `Polymer.Collection.getItem(key)` with an undefined key.
    -   Calling `Polymer.Base.notifyPath(path, value)` where the path cannot be
        dereferenced to the leaf.

    These now fail gracefully again.

-   Fixes [3065](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3065). Add
    `dom-repeat.renderedItemCount` property.

-   Fixes [3076](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3076). The
    `beforeRegister` callback was being called twice.

-   Fixes [3077](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3077). Listeners on
    `data-change` events may not be called if the property is bound. This was a
    regression introduced in Release 1.2.2.

-   Fixes [3083](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3083). Remove closures
    holding element references after `mouseup`/`touchend`.

-   Fixes [3084](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3084). Bindings with
    wildcard arguments to inline computing functions fail to parse Include
    wildcard character in identifier.

-   Fixes [3108](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3108). Moves `debounce`
    functionality from polymer-micro to polymer-mini. The functionality belongs
    in the mini layer and was never actually functional in micro.

-   Fixes [3113](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3113). Add an optional
    async argument to `importHref`.

-   Fixes [3115](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3115). Make
    `Polymer.dom.flush` reentrant-safe.

-   Fixes [3125](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3125). Ensure `dom-if`
    in host does not restamp when host detaches.

-   Fixes [3128](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3128),
    [3121](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3121). Computed bindings:
    outer scope property forwarding errantly forwarded literals as properties.
    This triggered a bug on Safari,"TypeError: Attempting to change the setter of
    an unconfigurable property."

-   Fixes [3157](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3157). Data-bound text
    nodes in a dom-if show up when they should be hidden.

-   Fixes [3214](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3214). Fix for
    `Polymer.dom(...)._query()` method doesn't exist which causes
    `Polymer.updateStyles()` to fail.

-   Fixes [3270](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3270). Cannot bind to
    `isAttached`.

-   Fixes [3285](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3285). SVGs inside an
    element's local DOM are styled improperly on IE.

-   Fixes [3295](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3295). `getOwnerRoot`
    incorrect when queried after an element is added from within a document
    fragment.

-   Fixes [3308](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3308). `Polymer.dom`
    element accessors can be incorrect when an element has no logical nodes.

-   Fixes [3321](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3321).  Only let
    `dom-repeat` insert elements in attached if it has been previously detached;
    correctly avoid re-adding children in document fragments to an element's
    logical linked list if they are already there.

-   Fixes [3324](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3324). Ensure `dom-if`
    moved into doc fragment is torn down.

-   Fixes [3337](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3337). Fixes an issue
    that was detected when an a doc fragment that did not include an insertion
    point was added after one that did but before distribution.

## [Release 1.2.3](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.2.3) (2015-11-16)

This release fixes the following issues:

-   Fixes [#2381](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2381),
    [#2708](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2708): Fix ordering
    issues with `custom-style` elements that apply custom properties defined
    in other `custom-style` elements.

## [Release 1.2.2](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.2.2) (2015-11-12)

This release includes a number of small optimizations affecting startup time.

This release includes the following new features:

-   Fixes [#2511](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2511). Add
    support for `strip-whitespace` attribute on templates. A template defined
    with the `strip-whitespace` attribute removes any empty text nodes from the
    template contents, which can result in a minor performance improvement.


-   Fixes [#2537](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2537). Add optional
    incremental "chunked" rendering to `dom-repeat`.

    New properties:

    -   `initialCount`. Enables incremental rendering and sets initial render count
    -   `targetFramerate`. Determines the target frame budget for rendering the remaining items.

    If `initialCount` is set, after setting (or re-setting) `items`, the initial count will be rendered pre-paint, and all remaining items will be incrementally rendered at `requestAnimationFrame` timing. The template makes a best-effort attempt to hit
    the framerate specified by `targetFramerate`.

-   Fixes [#2690](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2690). Add new
    `getComputedStyleValue` method to determine the computedn style of a custom
    property. Usage:

    <code><var>propertyValue</var> = <var>element</var>.getComputedStyleValue(<var>propertyName</var>);</code>

    This is equivalent to the native:

    <code><var>propertyValue</var> = getComputedStyle(<var>element</var>).getPropertyValue(<var>property</var>);


This release includes the following bug fixes and improvements:

-   Fix compound bindings with braces in literals.

-   Fixes [#2639](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2639). Fix for
    BEM-like CSS selectors under media queries. This issue affected CSS selectors
    that included two dashes inline, such as `foo--bar`.

-   Fixes [#2641](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2641). Fix gestures
    when using shadow DOM polyfill.

-   Fixes [#2649](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2649).
    `queryAllEffectiveChildren` method throws an exception.

-   Fixes [#2650](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2650). Add support
    for short unicode escape sequences in CSS rules.

-   Fixes [#2660](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2660). Fix parsing
    of custom properties with 'var' in value.

-   Fixes [#2670](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2670). Fix
    for multiple consequent spaces present in CSS selectors.

-   Fixes [#2685](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2685): `dom-if`
    throws exception if detached before instance is stamped.


## [Release 1.2.1](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.2.1) (2015-10-29)

This release includes the following new features:

-   Add `deepContains` method to DOM API.

This release includes fixes for the following issues:

-   Make parsing of mixin declarations more robust.

-   [Fixes #2556](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2556).
    `notifyPath`: Ensure outer paths aren't forwarded to instance props.

-   [Fixes #2610](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2610).
    `isLightDescendant` should return false for self.

## [Release 1.2.0](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.2.0) (2015-10-22)

This release includes the following new features:

-   Compound binding support. In place of a single binding annotation, you
    can now use a compound binding consisting of string literals and
    binding annotations:

        <span>Name: {%raw%}{{lastname}}, {{firstname}}{%endraw%}</span>

    See [Compound bindings](devguide/data-binding.html#compound-bindings) for details.

-   New `observeNodes` method for tracking addition and removal of child
    nodes and distributed nodes. See [Observe added and removed children](devguide/local-dom.html#observe-nodes).

-   New _effective children_ APIs that provide a composition-aware view of
    light DOM children. See [Effective children](devguide/local-dom.html#effective-children).

-   Improvements to path API.
    [Fixes #2007](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2007),
    [#2509](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2509).

    *    Allows `set` to take paths with array keys, identified by
         <code>#<var>key</var></code>.
    *    Allows `notifyPath` to take paths with array indices.
    *    Exposes public `notifySplices` API.


-   [Fixes #2582](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2582). Fix IE10 regressions
    in dom-repeat, dom-bind, and dom-module-inline

-   Fix deepEqual on Safari 9 due to Safari enumeration bug.

-   Add `Polymer.dom(node).notifyObservers` method to 'kick' observers, for example,
    when attributes change under Shadow DOM.


## [Release 1.1.5](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.1.5) (2015-10-08)

This release includes the following new features:

-   Added `isLightDescendent` and `isLocalDescendent` utility methods to
    {{site.project_title}} elements.

-   The `fire` method's `detail` argument can take any primitive value, not just objects.

This release fixes the following issues:

- [Fixes #2504](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2504). Templatizer: Variables in the parent scope are not passed during initialization.

- [Fixes #2505](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2504). Templatizer: Changes to array/object properties from the parent scope not notified.

## [Release 1.1.4](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.1.4) (2015-09-25)

This release fixes the following issues:

-   [Fixes #2452](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2452). Work around
    a [Chromium bug](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=529941)
    that caused memory to leak on page refresh.

-   [Fixes #2048](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2048). Allow multiple
    paths to be linked using `linkPath`.

## [Release 1.1.3](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.1.3) (2015-09-04)

-   [Fixes #2403](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2403). Fixes a regression
    that affected legacy projects using Chrome 39.

## [Release 1.1.2](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2403) (2015-08-28)

-   [Fixes #2356](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2356). Log a warning
    if the included style module cannot be found.

-   [Fixes #2357](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2357). Styles included
    with `include=` are inserted _before_ any styles defined in the body of
    the style element.

-   [Fixes #2363](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2363). Explicitly create
    `Polymer` object on `window` to satisfy strict mode.

-   [Fixes #2329](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2329). Registration changes
    to support ES6 classes.

-   [Fixes #2341](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2341). Branch `Polymer.dom` to
    use native dom methods under Shadow DOM for `appendChild`, `insertBefore`, `removeChild`,
    `replaceChild`, and `cloneNode`.

-   [Fixes #2334](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2341). When composing nodes
    in shady DOM, check if a node is where we expect it to be before removing it from
    its distributed position. We do this because the node may have been moved by
    `Polymer.dom` in a way that triggered distribution of its previous location. The
    node is already where it needs to be so removing it from its parent when it's no
    longer distributed is destructive.

[Release 1.1.1](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.1.1) (2015-08-20)

This release fixes a serious regression in Release 1.1 related to shady DOM distribution. Related issues:

- [Fixes #2276](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2276): DOM API fails to select an element in a `dom-repeat` in Polymer 1.1.  ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/ee61627))

- [Fixes #2311](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2311), [#2323](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2323): When elements are removed from their previous position when they are added elsewhere, make sure to remove them from composed, not logical parent. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/3d93116))

- [Fixes #2253](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2253): Refine logical tree check and populate parents of insertion points with logical info only if necessary. [Fixes #2283](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2283): when a node is removed, we need to potentially distribute not only its host but also its parent. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/6619f6c))


**Other fixed issues:**

- [Fixes #2263](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2263): Ensure `custom-style` can parse variable definitions in supported selectors (e.g. /deep/) without exception due to unknown css. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/894492b))

- `array-selector`: Add `selectedItem` property. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/d65acd0))

- `dom-repeat`: [Fixes #2297](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2297), Where a
`dom-repeat` with a `sort` property threw an exception when removing 10 or more items at a time. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/fccbd8a))

- [Fixes #2267](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2267): Properly find dom-module for mixed case elements. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/76c58b8))

- [Fixes #2304](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2304): Avoid trying to read style data from imports that did not load. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/0d1f206))

- Support for negative numbers in computed bindings. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/fc53f50))


## [Release 1.1.0](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.1.0) (2015-08-13)


**Shared style change**

This release includes support for a new style sharing mechanism. The new mechanism
should be used in place of `<link rel="import" type="css">`.

See [Shared styles and external stylesheets](devguide/styling.html#style-modules) in
the Developer guide for details.

As a result of these changes, several recommendations are changing:

*   `<link rel="import" type="css">` is deprecated and will eventually be removed. This syntax
    allowed users to use a pure .css file, but the file is parsed as HTML which is a
    security and performance concern.

*   We now recommend placing an element's `<style>` tag _inside_ the element's local DOM
    template, not outside. The older style is still supported, but does not perform as well
    as placing the styles inside the template.

**Fixed issues:**

- [Fixes #2251](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2251): Resolve imported stylesheets against correct document. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/68af666))

- Add logical info if an element being added is an insertion point; do not add logical info for any element in a shady root. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/45cb150))

- [Fixes #2235](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/2235). Manages logical information in shady distribution more directly by capturing it explicitly when needed and not whenever distribution is run. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/21500fb))

- Ensure path fixup is applied correctly to styles in templates. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/b22f3cd))

- `dom-module` no longer needs to eagerly upgrade custom elements since the web components polyfills do this automatically. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/051e1bf))

([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/2bffc4c))

- Fixes [vulcanize#209](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize/issues/209).

### Documentation correction

The Migration guide has been updated to reflect that the
[`iron-flex-layout`](migration.html#layout-attributes)
custom properties are the recommended replacement for layout attributes in
Release 1.0. The layout classes previously described
in the Migration guide for Releases 0.8 and 0.9 will continue to work for
now, but are deprecated.

## Release 0.9

A number of APIs changed between 0.8-rc.2 and 0.9. This section summarizes the changes.

### Element registration changes

#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> Mixins replaced by behaviors

Mixins have been replaced by _behaviors_, which can define properties, add
lifecycle callbacks, observers, and event listeners.

Specify behaviors using the `behaviors` array on the prototype:

    Polymer({
      is: "enhanced-element",
      behaviors: [CoolBehavior]
    });

For details, see [Behaviors](devguide/behaviors.html).

#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> constructor renamed to factoryImpl

When creating a custom constructor, the configuration function is
renamed from `constructor` to `factoryImpl`, to aid compilation tools.

#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> hostAttributes changes {#host-attributes}

Static attributes defined in `hostAttributes` can now be overridden from markup.

As a part of this change, the `class` attribute can no longer be set from
`hostAttributes`. If you need to set classes on the host, you can do so
imperatively (for example, by calling `classList.add` from the `ready` callback).

### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> Property observer changes

The format for property observers has changed to be more like the format for computed properties:

Before:

    observers: {
      'preload src size': 'updateImage'
    },

    updateImage: function(preload, src, size) {
      // ... do work using dependent values
    }

After:

    observers: [
      'updateImage(preload, src, size)'
    ],

    updateImage: function(preload, src, size) {
      // ... do work using dependent values
    }

Also, property observers are not invoked until **all** dependent properties are defined.
If the observer is not being invoked, make sure all dependent properties have non-`undefined`
default values set.

### Styling changes

#### Custom property support

This release includes several enhancements and changes to custom property support:

*   Custom property support is enabled for all elements. The `enableCustomStyleProperties`
    flag is no longer required.

*   <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> Style mixins are applied with `@apply` instead of `mixin`.

        @apply(--my-style-mixin)

*   The `var` function allows you to supply a default value, which is used if the custom
    property is not defined:

        background-color: var(--my-background, red);

*   Custom properties and mixins can be used inside a mixin.

        --foo: {
          color: var(--my-color);
          @apply(--my-theme);
        };


#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> x-style renamed to custom-style

The `custom-style` element replaces the experimental `x-style` element.

Custom properties and CSS mixins can now be applied inside a `custom-style` element.

For more details, see [Custom element for document styling](devguide/styling.html#custom-style).

#### Support for :root selector

Styling now supports the [`:root` pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root)
inside `custom-style`. In the context of a `custom-style` element, the `:root` selector lets
you define a custom property that applies to all custom elements. (In 0.8, applying a property to
all custom elements required a more expensive `*` selector.)

### Data binding changes

#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> Template helper elements no longer experimental

The template helper elements are no longer experimental, and have been renamed:

*  `x-repeat` is now `dom-repeat`.
*  `x-bind` is now `dom-bind`.
*  `x-array-selector` is now `array-selector`.
*  `x-if` is now `dom-if`.

#### Nested template support

As of 0.9, nested templates can access their parent's scope. See [Nesting dom-repeat templates](devguide/templates.html#nesting-templates) for details.

#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> Array mutation methods

In 0.8, an array observer was used to monitor the mutation of arrays, so adding an
item to an array was observed automatically, but changing a value in an array item required
the `setPathValue` method (now renamed to `set`).

0.9 replaces the array observers with a set of array mutation methods. For array changes
to be observed by data bindings, computed properties, or observers, you must use the provided
helper methods: `push`, `pop`, `splice`, `shift`, and `unshift`. Like `set`, the first argument
is a string path to the array.

```
this.push('users', { first: "Stephen", last: "Maturin" });
```

### Gesture support

This release adds limited gesture support. For details, see [Gesture events](devguide/events.html#gestures).

### Content security policy (CSP) {#csp}

CSP issues in the initial release of 0.8 have been resolved. CSP still requires separate script and
HTML files.

The CSP-specific functions of [`vulcanize`](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize) have been
split into a separate utility, [`crisper`](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/crisper). To prepare a site for
deployment in a CSP environment, you can use a command like this:

    vulcanize --inline-scripts --inline-css target.html | \
        crisper --html build.html --js build.js

For more details on the `vulcanize` arguments, see the [README](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize).

**Note:** The latest versions of `vulcanize` are **not** compatible with {{site.project_title}} 0.5.
For 0.5 projects, use `vulcanize` versions **earlier than 1.0**. `vulcanize` 0.7.10 is the latest version
supporting 0.5 projects.

### Utility functions

#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> transform and translate3d API changes

The method signatures for the `transform` and `translate3d` utility methods have
changed to match the other utility methods. The `node` argument is now the last argument,
and is optional. If `node` is omitted, the methods act on `this`.

Before:

    transform(node, transform);
    translate3d(node, x, y, z);

After:

    transform(transform, node);
    translate3d(x, y, z, node);

#### <span class="breaking">breaking change:</span> fire API changes

The `fire` method now takes three arguments:

    fire(type, [detail], [options]);

The `options` object can contain the following properties:

*   `node`. Node to fire the event on. Defaults to `this`.
*   `bubbles`. Whether the event should bubble. Defaults to `true`.
*   `cancelable`. Whether the event can be canceled with `preventDefault`. Defaults to `false`.

#### New utilities

The following utility functions were added since 0.8-rc.2 _or_ were missing
from the earlier documentation:

*   `$$`
*   `cancelAsync`
*   `debounce`
*   `cancelDebouncer`
*   `flushDebouncer`
*   `isDebouncerActive`

For details, see [Utility functions](devguide/utility-functions.html).

### Bug fixes

Release 0.9 includes a number of bug fixes. A few notable fixes are listed below.


- The `id` attribute can now be data bound. (Note that if `id` is data bound,
  the element is omitted from `this.$`.)

- Default values are now set correctly for read-only properties.

- An identifier with two dashes in the middle (`c--foo`) was improperly interpreted
  as a CSS custom property name.

- Fixed several issues with computed bindings, including one where the computing function
  was not invoked unless its dependent property was included in another binding.
