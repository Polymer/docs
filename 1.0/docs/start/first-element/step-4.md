Of course, a button isn't a button if you can't click it. To toggle the button,
add an event listener. To add event listeners on the host element (in this
case, `icon-toggle`), add a `listeners` object to the element prototype:

#### icon-toggle.html
{: .caption }


<pre class="prettyprint">
  Polymer({
    /* this is the element's prototype */
    is: 'icon-toggle',
    properties: {
      toggleIcon: String,
      pressed: {
        type: Boolean,
        value: false,
        notify: true,
        reflectToAttribute: true
      }
    },
    listeners: {
      'tap': 'toggle'
    },
    toggle: function() {
      this.pressed = !this.pressed;
    },
  });
</pre>

Key information:

*   The [`listeners object`](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/events.html#event-listeners)
    provides a simple way to set up event handlers. It maps event names to handler names.

*   The `tap` event is generated by Polymer's [gesture system](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/events.html#gestures)
    when the user clicks or taps on a target with a mouse or finger. (The `listeners` object works with built-in events
    like `keydown` and `keyup`, too.)

Save the `icon-toggle.html` file and look at the demo again. You should be able to press the button and see it
toggle between its pressed and unpressed states.

**Learn more: data binding.** To see how the demo works, open `icon-toggle-demo.html`
and take a look around (if you downloaded the code, you'll find this file in the `demo` folder.)
Yes, the demo for this element is _also_ an element. The
element uses <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-binding.html#property-notification">two-way
data binding</a> and a <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/data-binding.html#annotated-computed">computed
binding</a> to change the string displayed when you toggle the button.
