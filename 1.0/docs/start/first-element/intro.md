In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build elements using Polymer 1.0. You'll
create a simple Polymer element, a toggle button. The finished button will look
something like this:


![Sample star-shaped toggle buttons, showing pressed and unpressed state](../../../images/first-element/sample-toggles.png)

You'll be able to use it with simple markup like this:


<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;icon-toggle>&lt;/icon-toggle>
</pre>

This project introduces you to most of the key concepts in working with
Polymer.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything. Each of the concepts presented
here is described in detail in the Polymer documentation.


## Step 1: Get set up

To follow this tutorial, you'll need:

-   The starting code.
-   Node.js and Polyserve command-line tools to run the demo.


**Don't want to install anything?** To run through this tutorial online,
open the [starter project on Plunker](https://plnkr.co/edit/QfsudzAPCbAu56Qpb7eB?p=preview){:target="_blank"}
and click **Fork** to create your own working copy. Then skip straight to
<a href="step-2.html">Step 2: Add local DOM.</a>
{: .alert .alert-info }



### Download the starting code

1.  Click the button to download the starting code as a ZIP file.

    <div>
      <a href="https://github.com/googlecodelabs/polymer-first-elements/releases/download/v1.0/polymer-first-elements.zip">
        <paper-button raised id="download-button">
          <core-icon icon="file-download"></core-icon>
          Download ZIP
        </paper-button>
      </a>
    </div>

2.  Expand the archive to create your project folder.

    Your project folder should look something like
    this:

    <pre>
    README.md
    bower.json
    bower_components/
    demo/
    icon-toggle-finished/
    icon-toggle.html
    </pre>

    The main file you'll work with is <code>icon-toggle.html</code>, which contains the definition for your custom element.


### Install Node.js and Polyserve


You need to install some command-line tools to run the demo locally.

1.  Download and install Node from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
    Node includes the node package manager command, `npm`.

2.  Install `polyserve`:

        npm install -g polyserve


## Run the demo

To run the element demo:

1.  Run `polyserve` from the repo directory:

        polyserve

2.  Open `localhost:8080/components/icon-toggle/demo/` in your browser.
    (Note that the path uses `icon-toggle`—the
    component name listed in this element's `bower.json` file—rather than the actual directory name.)

**Note:**
If you're wondering what `polyserve` does, see [Testing elements with local bower dependencies](../reusableelements.html#local-dependencies).
{: .alert .alert-info }

You'll see some text where the icon toggles should appear. It doesn't look
very interesting, but it shows that everything is working.


<img src="../../../images/first-element/starting-state.png" alt="Initial state of the demo. The demo shows three icon-toggle elements, two labeled 'statically-configured icon toggles' and one labeled 'data-bound icon toggle'. Since the icon toggles are not implemented yet, they appear as placeholder text reading 'Not much here yet'." title="Initial demo">

**If this text doesn't appear**, make sure you're looking at the the demo folder itself, or at `demo/index.html`,
not at `toggle-icon.html` or `toggle-icon-demo.html`.
{: .alert .alert-info }

<div horizontal layout end-justified class="stepnav">
  <a href="step-2.html">
    <paper-button raised><core-icon icon="arrow-forward"></core-icon>Step 2: Add local DOM</paper-button>
  </a>
</div>
