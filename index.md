<p class="lead">
{{site.project_title}} is a new type of library for the web, built on top of Web Components,
and designed to leverage the evolving web platform on modern browsers.
</p>

## Quick start

1. Clone the project to your app's root folder. See [Get the code](/getting-the-code.html).

        git clone git://github.com/Polymer/polymer.git --recursive

2. **Fire up a web server** in your app's directory.
3. Include `polymer.js` in your main page:

        <script src="Polymer/polymer.js"></script>

4. Read the [Getting Started](/getting-started.html) guide.
5. Learn how to soup-up your web components using the [Polymer kernel](/polymer.html).
6. Play with the [toolkit-ui examples](https://github.com/Polymer/toolkit-ui) (*also must be run from a web server)*.
7. Join the [mailing list](/discuss.html)! Ask questions and give feedback.

<h2 style="clear:both;">What is {{site.project_title}}?</h2>

{{site.project_title}} is comprised of two efforts:

- A set of core platform features ([Shadow DOM](/platform/shadow-dom.html),
[Custom Elements](/platform/custom-elements.html), [MDV](/platform/mdv.html)).
Initially, these core features will be enabled with a set of polyfills. As browsers
begin to implement these new primitives, the polyfill platform layer becomes smaller and better over time.
- A next-generation web application framework built upon these core technologies called the **_{{site.project_title}}_**.

The architectural stack looks like this:

## Guiding principles

The overall aim of {{site.project_title}} is to manage the complexity of building web applications. Our principles are:

**Everything is a component** — Encapsulation is the key to creating scalable, maintainable applications. All {{site.project_title}} resources are components, even ones that are non-visual. To construct an app, a developer creates new components, or uses ones {{site.project_title}} provides, and assembles them together. Focusing on individual, composable building blocks allows developers to "think locally" about their application, reducing complexity. With this divide-and-conquer approach, applications can simultaneously be simple and arbitrarily complicated.

**Extreme pragmatism** — Developers should write the **minimum** amount of code possible to create their application. Anything repetitive should be re-factored into a component, handled by {{site.project_title}} itself, or added into the browser platform itself. {{site.project_title}} provides simple syntax without reducing features, and avoids boilerplate wherever possible.

**Salt to taste** —  Use as much or as little of the framework as you wish. An application can choose to only load `polymer/platform/platform.js` to take advantage of the polyfills, or add `polymer/polymer.js` to
provide extra batteries for web components. We call these types of
elements ["{{site.project_title}} elements"](/polymer.html).
