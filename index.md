## What is {{site.project_title}}?

{{site.project_title}} is a new type of library for the web, built on top of Web Components,
and designed to leverage the evolving web platform on modern browsers.

## Guiding principles

<div class="centered video"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLRAVCSU_HVYu-zlRaqArF8Ytwz1jlMOIM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The overall aim of {{site.project_title}} is to manage the complexity of building web applications.

**Use the platform** —  Use as much or as little of the framework as you wish. An application can choose to load `platform.js` for just the polyfills or use `polymer.js` to give web components extra batteries. We call these types of elements ["{{site.project_title}} elements"](/polymer.html).

**Everything is an element** — Encapsulation is the key to creating scalable, maintainable applications. All {{site.project_title}} resources are components, even ones that are non-visual. To construct an app, a developer creates new components, or uses ones {{site.project_title}} provides, and assembles them together. Focusing on individual, composable building blocks allows developers to "think locally" about their application, reducing complexity. With this divide-and-conquer approach, applications can simultaneously be simple and arbitrarily complicated.

**Eliminate boilerplate** — Developers should write the **minimum** amount of code possible to create their application. Anything repetitive should be re-factored into a component, handled by {{site.project_title}} itself, or added into the browser platform itself. {{site.project_title}} provides simple syntax without reducing features, and avoids boilerplate wherever possible.
